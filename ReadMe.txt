Heyy,

Firstly, install pyautogui... you can search in youtube on how to install that

create a text file which contains the code, enter the path of text file in "Code Solver.py"( I have mentioned where to insert ). for example:"C:/Users/kingchampfizz/Desktop/skillrack_code.txt"
make sure to remove indentations in the code (skillrack puts them automatically, ughhh) in the text file
**to remove indentations copy paste the code in any python ide text file, select the whole code and repeatedly press "ctrl+[" until all the indentations are gone.
Now save the text file

now run "Code Solver.py"

YOU HAVE 20 SECS TO SELECT A POSITION WHERE TO ENTER IN SKILLRACK AFTER RUNNING THE CODE ( You can change the time as per your convenience in the python code )
Open skilrack and click the cursor on where to enter the code.
